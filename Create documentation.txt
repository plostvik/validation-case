I need to Update Readme.md with info about my github project. Requirements: Application description: 2 paragraphs, 4-10 Sentences. Information on how to install/run the developed application locally.

My project - is a form which collects user data in a form of {
    firstName: '',
    lastName: '',
    email: '',
    message: '',
  };
Form have validation and a submit button. After user press submit form is validationg and if everything is okey  - new data is stored into a redux store. After submitting new data to the store we're updating a table to show that data has been collected.

Alsy my app has unit tests to test if form works and connects with store

Packages used: redux, react-redux, validator

Certainly! Below is a sample README.md for your GitHub project:

Project Name
Description
This project consists of a user data collection form, gathering information such as the first name, last name, email, and a message from the user. The form includes validation to ensure that the data is correctly formatted and meets specific criteria before it's accepted. Once the user presses the submit button, and if validation is successful, the new data is stored in a Redux store.

The application's functionality doesn't stop there; after submitting the new data to the store, a table is updated to visually represent that the data has been collected. This streamlined process ensures that the collected information is handled efficiently and visibly within the application's user interface. Unit tests are also included within the project, ensuring that the form's functionality and its connection with the store operate correctly.

In the example above, `<Note>` is a made-up JSX component that you can use to represent a note. If you're using a component library or have custom components, you can replace `<Note>` with any of your custom components.

Remember to replace `username` and `your-repo-name` with the correct details.
